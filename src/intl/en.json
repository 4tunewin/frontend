Nope, as the contract keeps track of secret number's hash, meaning the operator cannot change the number after the bet has been accepted. Mixing the block hash with the numbers makes the result totally random yet disallows miners from crafting winning bets. On the other hand, 4tune.win themselves cannot control bet outcomes either because of block hash component. This is a well-known <a href=\"https: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"commitment scheme\"</a> which enables 4tune.win to provide gambling-grade random number generation allowing for big bets, jackpots and quick settlements while being fully transparent.",
